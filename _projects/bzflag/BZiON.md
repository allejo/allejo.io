BZiON is an open source website written for BZFlag's Leagues United to manager players, teams, matches, and tournaments. The project was started because the existing project was lacking in several features and I took exception to the existing codebase after I had to add the ability to automatically report matches. After working with [3 extremely talented developers](https://github.com/allejo/bzion#developers) for [2 years, 6 months and 30 days](http://helit.tech/bzion-stats/), the first version of the project was released.
