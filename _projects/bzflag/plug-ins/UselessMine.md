Useless Mine is a plug-in that gives the Useless flag a purpose: to leave mines on the battlefield. As players drive over these hidden mines placed by opponents, a shockwave will explode at their location. This plug-in also introduces the Bomb Defusal flag, which allows players to combat and defuse hidden mines.
