Persistent Mutes is a modification to the `/mute` system on BZFlag servers. bzfs' default behavior mutes are automatically deleted whenever a player leaves meaning that players can rejoin to bypass a mute. This plug-in will save all mutes for 5 hours so players who rejoin to bypass the mute will remain muted.
