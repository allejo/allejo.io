A plugin that allows you add shot limits to a flag based on the location of where it was grabbed. The difference between this plugin and the default `-sl` option is that by using the option, you are limiting all of the flags of the same type where with this plugin you will only limit the shot limit of a flag if grabbed from a specific area in the map.
