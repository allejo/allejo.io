CTF Overseer implements all of the CTF-related features from Planet MoFo's Apocalypse map. This plug-in has a number of features relating to capture events such as,

- Disable self-captures
- Disable a team flag from being grabbed X seconds after it was capped (prevent "pass-camping")
- Award bonus points to the player who capped the flag based on team counts
- Announce custom messages on capture events
