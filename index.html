                    <p>Most of my experience has been with both front and back-end development. I spent a lot of time working in Photoshop creating designs and the rest of my time is spent working with HTML and Sass on building a website from an initial design. I have a lot of experience working with Jekyll for creating static websites, as well as working with Bootstrap for web designs that do not require custom built solutions.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I work with JavaScript a lot for making websites interactive and have recently begun building AngularJS tools mainly for private use.</p>
                    <p>For back-end development, I am most experienced with PHP and using Symfony or Silex depending on the need of the application; I have also recently begun using C# for web development.</p>

                    <p>I am very active in the open source community and do my best to contribute to it as best as I can. The majority of my work has always been open source and will continue to be open source.</p>
                    <p>Even though I may not contribute directly to an open source project, I do join the community and help others as I can if I have the knowledge to do so. Some of the communities or projects that I am a part of are,</p>
