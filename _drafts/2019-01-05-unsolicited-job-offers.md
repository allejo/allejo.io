It's a new year and some things simply refuse to change with the times. When I was much younger, I'd get excited about receiving messages from recruiters on LinkedIn. I thought to myself that I was actually in demand. The ignorance of youth, am I right? Truthfully, I'm not popular enough or patient enough to get anything out of LinkedIn; so to me, it's a joke and I treat it as such.

I accepted the job offer for my current position end of May 2018 and I updated my LinkedIn accordingly the same day so I wouldn't get recruiters sending me messages any more. Little did I know, that meant absolutely nothing to recruiters. I kept receiving unsolicited messages regularly from recruiters until mid August 2018 when I disabled InMails. Yes. I had to completely disable a feature on LinkedIn, because despite my happily starting a new job less than 2 months, apparently I was still wanted at "a great full-time opportunity with a profitable and long-standing successful company." That's right everyone, I got a job offer atâ€”wait, what company is this that supposedly wants me?

Did disabling InMails solve my problem? If you think so, you are horribly mistaken. Instead of InMails, I was not receiving connection requests from recruiters sending me their messages via friend requests. Why would anyone think that was a good idea?

Don't get me wrong, being a recruiter must be a tough job and I respect it. Every job is a respectable job. But please put effort into your job and don't just use the same generic and templated messages for everyone. One InMail I received included this gem:

> We work using Paired Programming and Extreme Programming methods to build Next-Gen Tech from AI, Machine Learning to drones and we offer some amazing perks. No other company is doing what we are!

Every company is building "next generation technology" nowadays. If this were true, there would be a lot more real R&D going on for the betterment of society. Remember blockchain and the all hype it got? I'm sure that was "next-gen" too.

Why am I giving recruiters such a hard time? Why am I hating on their methods? Because it's only fair to do so, in my opinion. As an employer, how would you feel if you got a resume that consisted of just the following:

- Rock star programming
- Worked on next-gen tech at a profitable and long-standing successful company
- No other developer does what I do!

Would you call this individual in for an interview? I wouldn't. Not even if I was absolutely desperate because it shows a lack of effort on the applier's part. So when recruits do essentially the same thing, it shows a lack of effort.

@ So what do I do? I have a message "hidden away" in my profile that's very out of the blue
@ sending inmails is a game of gambling, responses + no responses

Wait. If I don't like LinkedIn, why do I still have one and advertise the link with my other social media links? Because it's blasphemy for someone in my age group not have one.
