I've been a part of the open source community since 2009 when I first started participating in the BZFlag community. I was lucky that I was able to meet a lot of supportive people in the community who were willing to take the time to teach me, I owe a lot to this community for helping me become who I am today. This is something that I've been wanting to talk about somewhat in-depth for a while but never felt it appropriate to do so because for the longest time, I thought I was the only one. I have since seen others talk about this same problem such as [Mike McQuaid](https://mikemcquaid.com/2018/03/19/open-source-maintainers-owe-you-nothing/) and [Fabien Potencier](https://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer/issues/63#issuecomment-368115050).

I don't maintain any large open source projects so I can't even begin to imagine what those maintainers have to go through. The BZFlag community has been dwindling for years now but no matter the size of the community, [burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout) and being demoralized is still possible. Trust me, I've felt it. I spend a lot of my free time contributing to the BZFlag community and working on things because I genuinely enjoy it and I often use it as a learning experience or a medium for me to experiment on. I build things and maintain them because it's fun and I care about my projects; remember, I'm doing all of this voluntarily and I have the same amount of hours in a day as anyone else. Something I learned ages ago and am still reminded of it often is that it's just not possible to make everyone happy and if my decisions affect other people, there's likely to be some controversy or backlash. Remember when people were upset about plain red Starbucks Christmas cups? Well, it's very similar to dealing with players on the [Internet who believe they are always right](https://xkcd.com/386/).

McQuaid points out that the open source world seems to have slowly "adopted an unsustainable business/customer-like relationship." I can't count the number of times I've apologized for my projects having a bug or a release being delayed, it just feels natural for me to do so. It's unlikely that I'll be able to stop that habit because then I'll be afraid of coming off as rude even though I did not mean to; it's happened in the past. I don't maintain any large and active open source projects so the context of my frustration is tied solely to the BZFlag community. With such a small community and no hard deadlines, time and development power are extremely limited. So, how do I decide what to work on? While I do prioritize things as best as I can based on player demand, I work on what I want. After all, I want to enjoy what I'm working on. It's up to my paying job to give me stuff to work on that I may not like.

So aside from pretending to be active on my site and writing about something that's been bugging me for a while, what's the point of this post? Why would you care? What can you do?

- Pull requests are genuinely welcome! If you want to learn and have a **genuine** interest, I'd be more than happy to help out. I received help from a lot of dedicated developers and I'd like to return the favor one day.
- Give feedback, good or bad. If I'm working on something, I'd like to hear others' thoughts on what I did right or what I could improve or maybe I just shouldn't waste my time on something.
- Be patient with requests; there are only so many hours in a day. Afterall, I still have school, work, and sleep to fit into my schedule.
- Be nice, please. No, really. Please. Be nice and respectful. Don't agree with something? That's cool! But keep your negativity and anger to yourself, or at least offline. It's really disheartening to have so much negativity and anger thrown at you.
- Be understanding. It's actually really simple. Just understand where I and other developers are coming from.

If you made it this far, you're either looking for a tl;dr or I should be thanking you for reading one of my rants. If it's the latter, I appreciate your time and thanks for reading! &hearts;
