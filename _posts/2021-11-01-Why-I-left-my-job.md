It's been over a year since I last wrote a blog post. Yes, I've been busy but I've also been lacking motivation to do so; I was mentally exhausted. I worked for three years at a state university here in California as a web developer and it became draining to me. I know it's taboo to speak poorly about your former employers but this post isn't about them; it's about my experience, why I left, and how I took care of myself.

## Career Growth

One of the biggest struggles I faced was the lack of career growth that was available to me. I worked on a team of 5 devs, including myself, but collaboration wasn't exactly common; we all essentially worked on separate projects and had very little overlap. Originally, we had established practices of reviewing each other's pull requests but we had to dissolve that policy when it started blocking our productivity since no one knew anyone else's projects; all PR approvals became meaningless. Coming from the open source community, I absolutely love code reviews! I have learned an incredible amount from other developers just from receiving code reviews. Working in an environment where I had no one else to review my code or give me feedback was making my career stagnate; I had no one I could learn from. Sure, I could learn things by myself and hope I understood them correctly, but that wouldn't advance my career; I'm early into my career, I don't want to stop learning now.

It's everyone's dream to be financially stable and I'm no different. Here comes the discussion of the salary. You know, that thing that employers hate talking about. Working for a state institution meant I was a state employee, and as part of the government, all our wages were publicly available. I understand why employers don't like publishing this data unless they are forced to. I was able to see my colleagues, whom I felt did a lot less work than me, earn significantly more money than me. The only way I was able to secure raises at my job was by threatening to quit; if that's not a red flag, I don't know what is. I felt that my contributions and my work made me worthy of receiving promotions but whenever I'd bring it up, my request would be dodged.

> John Doe has been working in his position for 10 years now and he hasn't gotten a promotion. Getting a promotion here is hard, you know.

Was that supposed to make me feel better? Because it didn't. If anything, it raised an even bigger red flag. It wasn't until my employer found out that I was actively applying for other positions that they offered the promotion I had been asking for with _slightly_ more money to stay; when I was told the amount I'd be given, it felt like a slap to the face.

At this point, I felt like all of the work I did carrying projects and managing a team of student developers was worthless. My student developers were the only ones keeping my motivation up and made me feel like the work I did mattered because they were learning and enjoying the projects and challenges I was giving them; either that or they should consider acting as a backup career.

I really felt like my career wasn't going anywhere if I stayed here. I had to leave.

## Culture

Every workplace has a culture; some are healthy and some are toxic. As I didn't want to grow complacent, I ended up pairing up with our cloud infrastructure team and established an informal DevOps team and introduced so many new things; e.g. automated and immutable deployments, CI/CD, shared internal utilities, and so much more. I was thoroughly enjoying this effort and we had achieved a lot but unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. That end came from management and older folks resistant to change. Introducing new technologies was an uphill battle as no one understood them and they didn't want to put effort into learning them.

> We've been doing things the same way for 10 years, and it's working fine for us. Why would we change anything?

The problem with growing complacent is that you fall behind; especially in the world of technology. What's the problem with falling behind? Remember the [hype COBOL had back in the early pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/new-jersey-seeks-cobol-programmers-to-fix-unemployment-system.html)? Well, New Jersey grew complacent with an antiquated technology and dug themselves into a hole once the few experts retired and no one was available to take their place. Don't get me wrong, if I have something personal that isn't broken, then I have no reason to fix it. However, when the system is as important as a university's infrastructure, it should be receiving constant improvements.

Remember how I mentioned there was a lack of collaboration on my team? Well, the problem spanned far wider than just my team. The informal DevOps team I had formed with my colleague was unheard of. Instead of praising us for our accomplishments, the question was, "who gets the credit?" This was a giant red flag and it was frustrating to see my work ignored because of something as trivial as which team is going to receive credit.

I was spending more time fighting for permission to introduce small, manageable changes to our infrastructure than I did actually writing any code. What was the point of working for an organization whose culture was to dismiss anything new or different? This culture was not for me. Another reason for me to leave.

## Leaving for Stack Overflow

I applied to other universities because I wanted to remain in the public sector. However, after I asked the interviewers what their work environments were like, I learned the environment I was going to go into wasn't very different compared to what I was trying to leave; this is why it's important to ask interviewers questions! I applied to many companies and the company I decided to leave for was Stack Overflow—a company I never thought I'd have the opportunity to work for. I'll write about getting hired at Stack Overflow in another blog post soon. Until then, allow me to explain why the environment at Stack Overflow has been a great choice for my career.

- Career growth
  - During negotiations, I was offered more than I requested. In retrospect, maybe I asked for too little? Nothing was stopping Stack Overflow from taking advantage of low self-worth and paying the low salary I requested.
  - Within the first month or so of working at Stack Overflow, my boss presented to me the promotion roadmap for my position; it clearly defined what I'd need to reach each level.
  - Code review galore! Unless the PR is a simple typo fix, everything gets code reviewed. I've already learned a lot from code review feedback.
- Culture
  - Everyone I have reached out to asking questions has been incredibly friendly and welcoming. These are complete strangers I had never met before but they were incredibly friendly and willing to share their knowledge with me.
  - If someone has experience on a subject, they'll be looped in even if they're not on the same team. At the completion of projects, everyone involved gets credit. Pretty simple, right?
  - Teams are working towards improvements and modernization constantly; remember how Stack Overflow migrated from .NET to .NET Core?

I never imagined that changing jobs would allow me to improve so many things in my life. With just a job change, I have accomplished the following:

- ✅ Financial stability
- ✅ Surrounded myself with teachers
- ✅ My work is being appreciated

## In Retrospect

I really wanted to stay in the public sector because I enjoyed providing services for the general good of people but they have been some of the most toxic environments for me. Switching to the private sector has been an enjoyable experience and is like night and day. Don't get me wrong, I could have totally ended up at a private sector company where the environment is toxic. I consider myself very lucky that I was presented with the opportunity to join a healthy work environment where I enjoy what I do.
