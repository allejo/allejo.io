Welcome to a new year. Only 15 days late but, whatever. Looking back at 2016, it was a pretty awesome year for me with regards to all of the projects I participated in. Here are some of my projects and accomplishments for 2016:

- BZiON had [its first major release](https://github.com/allejo/bzion/releases/tag/v0.9.0) after 2.5 years of development
- stakx development began and reached its [third beta](https://github.com/stakx-io/stakx/releases/tag/v0.1.0-beta3) with an incredible amount of features and bug fixes
- Published [web analytics for the City of Santa Monica](http://analytics.smgov.net/) and [automated the whole process](https://github.com/CityofSantaMonica/analytics.smgov.net/tree/master/App_Data/jobs/triggered)
- Wrote [my first Jekyll plug-in](https://github.com/CityofSantaMonica/jekyll-frontmatter-jsonify)
- Participated in my first Hacktoberfest

Starting on Dec 31st, 2016 and continuing into the first week of 2017, I spent my time rewriting my BZFlag plug-in starter to be [entirely JavaScript based](https://github.com/allejo/bzflagPluginStarter2) (where the first version was a [PHP script](https://github.com/allejo/bzflagPluginStarter)). I decided to tackle code generation in a object oriented approach by writing the library of that website in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and wrote the UI using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)â€”two things I had been wanting to learn/experiment with. TypeScript definitely makes writing object-oriented JS easier but one thing I really struggled with was the differences between ES5, ES6, ES2017, Babel, synonyms; the amount of jargon that exists in the JS world... It was a nightmare for me to get a grasp of things.

So what do I have planned for 2017? I definitely want to get more adept with JavaScript and TypeScript. I also really want to do more work with C#, C++, and Python. Lastly, I want to attempt to build my own lexer simply for the experience.
