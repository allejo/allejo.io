It's been an eternity since I launched my Jekyll based website (this one) but up until now, I hadn't done much with it nor had I done much with Jekyll. It wasn't until recently where at both of my jobs, I started using Jekyll a lot more and was able to experiment and discover some better practices. I'm no Jekyll expert but I finally feel comfortable enough with Jekyll and Liquid to work with it efficiently to get a product out. Better yet, I am comfortable enough to be able to assist on [#jekyll](irc://irc.freenode.net/jekyll); that's an IRC channel for you youngins who only know Slack.

I was finally able to dedicate a weekend to work on my website and well, here we are; this is it. There is still a lot more that I have planned for my personal website, but that will probably be built in the coming days. I'm not using any CSS frameworks other than Thoughtbot's Bourbon and my very own [OnTheRocks](https://github.com/allejo/OnTheRocks)â€”a flexbox based grid system built before they were cool and common. There is still a lot of Sass I need to rewrite, fix, or optimize and probably quirks on the website but I really hope none of them are embarrassingly bad.

Welcome into my life, Jekyll.
