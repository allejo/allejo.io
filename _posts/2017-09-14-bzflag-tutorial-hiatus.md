I never expected the *BZFlag Plug-ins for Dummies* series to get much traffic due to its nature; a very small community, few to no developers, etc. With regards to the current status of the project, I feel that I have covered enough of the API and plug-in writing to be helpful to new developers. For this reason, I'll be putting this series on hold for a while; by doing so, it'll allow me to focus on other projects that require my attention.

There is no estimate for how long this project will be on hold for. If you were following the series and would like to see it continued, please [let me know]({{ url(pages.Contact) }}) and tell me what you'd like to see covered. Until next time, thanks for the support! &hearts;
