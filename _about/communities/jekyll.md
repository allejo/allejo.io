I hang around [#jekyll](irc://irc.libera.chat/jekyll) on Libera and help out users. Some of my efforts for the Jekyll community have been through [open source themes](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme?q=user%3Aallejo) and [unorthodox projects](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-project?q=user%3Aallejo) to solve common problems in Jekyll without the use of plug-ins.

I created a Liquid-only, JavaScript-free, GitHub Actions-free way of...

- Generating a Table of Contents on GitHub Pages used by [Docker, UK Ministry of Justice, Apache, Google, JetBrains, and more](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc#jekyll-pure-liquid-table-of-contents).
- Adding anchors to headings (i.e., `h1` - `h6`) used by [Travis CI, Riot.js, Microsoft's (former) TypeScript website, and more](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-anchor-headings#jekyll-pure-liquid-heading-anchors).
