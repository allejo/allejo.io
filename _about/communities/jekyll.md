I hang around [#jekyll](irc://irc.freenode.net/jekyll) on Freenode and help out users. Some of my efforts for the Jekyll community have been through [open source themes](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme?q=user%3Aallejo) and [unorthodox projects](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-project?q=user%3Aallejo) to solve common problems in Jekyll without the use of plug-ins.

- Created the standard way to generate Table of Contents on GitHub Pages used by [Docker, UK Ministry of Justice, Apache, Google, JetBrains, and more](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc#jekyll-pure-liquid-table-of-contents)
