I spent time on [#socrata-soda](irc://irc.freenode.net/socrata-soda) on Freenode helping provide support for PHP users and general API help. Since I no longer use Socrata in the workplace or school, my participation in the community has diminished.

- Improved Excel support for [SODA.NET](https://github.com/CityofSantaMonica/SODA.NET)
- Wrote [PhpSoda](http://github.com/allejo/PhpSoda) as an alternative to the official PHP library
- Contributed to [dev.socrata.com](https://dev.socrata.com/) fixing UI issues
