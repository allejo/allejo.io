Student success is something every team on campus strives to achieve but that doesn't mean they achieve it. During my 2.5 years tenure on the web development team, I managed nearly a dozen students; mentoring them and teaching them how to work on real-world applications.

I talk about an "unorthodox" view of student success and why it's impactful to students in the field of technology; because let's face it, a lot of adults don't remember what it's like trying to get their first job. I also talk about what I learned on what worked and what didn't while managing students.
