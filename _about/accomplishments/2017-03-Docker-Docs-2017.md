I participated in [Docker's Docs Hackathon](https://web.archive.org/web/20170510062121/https://docs.docker.com/hackathon/) to help improve their documentation website. I'm not familiar enough with Docker to be able to update/write documentation so I participated in a way I could still benefit the community: I submitted [pull request #2860](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/pull/2860), which improved the responsive behavior of the website and reduced the redundancy of certain aspects of the site's Jekyll code. This single pull request fixed several known issues that existed and several issues that hadn't been reported yet.
