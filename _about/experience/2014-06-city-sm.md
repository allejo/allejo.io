I was a part of Santa Monica's web development team where I worked on building and maintaining city websites; additionally, I contributed to several of [their open source projects](https://github.com/CityofSantaMonica). Some of the bigger projects I worked on was building search functionality for [the Historic Resources Inventory database](https://www.smgov.net/Departments/PCD/Historic-Resources-Inventory/), [publishing our website analytics](http://analytics.smgov.net/), redesigning [the BigBlueBus website](http://bigbluebus.com/) to be mobile responsive, moving all Team Foundation Server repositories to Git, and getting automated previews for pull requests against our static websites.

During the summers of 2014, 2015, and 2016, I worked with the community broadband division and helped run the Youth Tech Program where I wrote the web development curriculum and served as the lead web development instructor. I covered topics such as, Git, GitHub Pages, and using Bootstrap to build mobile-responsive websites.
