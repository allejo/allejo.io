I am currently working on the Community Enablement team, which largely focuses on improving existing moderator tools and preparing for this year's Winter Bash. I'm a full-stack developer but spend more of my time working on the front-end portion of the website, such as revamping our dated JavaScript codebase to be converted into modules and rewriting portions of the website to be accessible. Additionally, I contribute to Stacks (our CSS framework and component library) on a semi-regular basis with bug fixes or accessibility fixes/improvements.

Previously, I was on the Community Products Engagement team. On this team, I worked on the long-term effort of sunsetting Developer Stories and the Jobs platform. This project required improvements to our GDPR process to be self-serving for the Jobs platform, splitting up tightly coupled code from our monolith application, and deleting all related data spread out through several databases.
