I was a full-stack developer focusing on front-end development, where I worked on the Community Enablement team. In this role, I contributed to improving existing moderator tools. I played a crucial role in revamping our JavaScript codebase by converting it into modules and rewriting portions of the website to enhance accessibility. Additionally, I actively contributed to Stacks, our CSS framework and component library, by providing bug fixes and implementing accessibility improvements.

In my previous role on the Community Products Engagement team, I participated in the long-term project of sunsetting Developer Stories and the Jobs platform. This involved enhancing our GDPR processes to enable self-serving options for the Jobs platform, refactoring tightly coupled code from our monolith application, and coordinating the deletion of related data across multiple databases.

Additionally, I was a founding member of two working groups, the front-end and accessibility guild, where I helped establish standards and guidelines for use across the organization. I designed and developed accessible UI components, including charts, character limit counters, draggable elements, and sortable tables. I unified the developer workflow for writing lightly interactive Stimulus components and heavily interactive Svelte components. My efforts significantly reduced the amount of JavaScript required by thousands of lines by introducing reusable Stimulus components.

I actively engaged with the Stack Exchange community, addressing bug reports and building valuable tools for site moderators. I was one of the three developers responsible for making Winter Bash 2023 possible; I wrote SQL queries for awarding hats, adding a fun and festive element to the community experience. Beyond my professional work, I volunteered as a mentor for Techtonica, a boot camp that supports women and non-binary individuals transitioning into the technology field.
