I work on the web development team for the central IT of the university. I work on a plethora of projects some of which include a Drupal-based website, Dialogflow based chatbot, our mobile app, custom CMS platforms, React static sites, and so much more. I'm actively involved in designing the deployment infrastructure and code architecture of our new tools. I mentor and help manage the student developers on our team and have them contribute to our production tools so they can become familiar with real-world design patterns and learn to collaborate with a team of developers.

I'm also involved with writing and designing accessible features for the main university website and our new tools. I collaborate extensively with the Universal Design Center to ensure we're always following best practices.
