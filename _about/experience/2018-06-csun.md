As a web developer for the central IT of the university, I actively led the development of multiple projects and managing a full team of student developers; my main focuses were software architecture, automation, code generation, and accessibility. I led the effort of building modular and reusable internal libraries designed to give development teams across platform a unified development experience.

Some libraries I designed include a framework for building API endpoints that can live on Lambda functions, a fully accessible front-end React component library, code generators, and documentation builders. Additionally, I maintained the Drupal 7-based website that powers CSUN's web presence and worked alongside the Universal Design Center (UDC) on improving its accessibility. Lastly, I managed the WordPress instances on campus that are used for our blogging network and course catalog.

I managed and mentored the student developers on our team ensuring they receive experience working on production-level projects and collaborating with other developers by using GitHub for all of our development and project management.
