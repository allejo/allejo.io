As a web developer for the central IT of the university, I am actively leading the development of multiple projects and managing a full team of student developers; my main focuses are software architecture, automation, code generation, and accessibility. I am leading the effort for building more modular and reusable internal libraries that are well documented and can be shared across teams from different departments on campus.

Some of the libraries I've designed include a framework for building API endpoints that can live on Lambda functions, a fully accessible front-end React component library, code generators, and documentation builders. Additionally, I maintain the Drupal 7-based website that powers CSUN's web presence and am constantly working along side the Universal Design Center (UDC) on improving its accessibility. Lastly, I also work on managing the WordPress instances on campus that are used for our blogging network and our course catalog.

I manage and mentor the student developers on our team ensuring they receive experience working on production-level projects and collaborating with other developers by using GitHub for all of our development and project management.
