I work on the web development team for the central IT of the university. I work on a plethora of projects some of which include a Drupal based website, Dialogflow based chatbot, our mobile app, custom CMS platforms, React static sites, and so much more. I dedicate a good chunk of my time to making sure the code updates we push out are accessible by collaborating with the Universal Design Center.
