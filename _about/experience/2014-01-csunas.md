I worked as a part of the marketing team as a web developer maintaining the [Associated Students website](https://www.csun.edu/as/) up to date with coming events and information about the services we provided. I did front-end development for the main website and built static websites for special events using Jekyll or stakx. I made sure that all of the organization's web pages were accessible and followed Section 508 requirements.

I built internal Symfony based tools and websites used for linking together different webhooks and APIs to our project management software; this allowed our team to use different services depending on our needs but were still able to use a single project management tool. Some of the components I built for these projects were made open source such as [PhpPulse](https://github.com/allejo/PhpPulse), a library for interacting with the monday.com API. These projects allowed us to have transparency with our clients as we gave them to ability to view the status of their project and communicate with the team more freely.
