I participated in [Docker's Docs Hackathon](https://web.archive.org/web/20170510062121/https://docs.docker.com/hackathon/) to help improve their documentation website. I'm not familiar enough with Docker to be able to update/write their documentation so I participated in a way I could still benefit the community: I submitted [pull request #2860](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/pull/2860), which improved the responsive behavior of the website and reduced the redundancy of certain aspects of the site's Jekyll code. This single pull request fixed several related issues that were open and some that hadn't even been opened yet.
