I worked with the web development team focusing on the front-end of their new department websites. While I spent the majority of my time working on the front-end of websites, I spent some time porting old VB code to C# in the websites that were being updated and worked on building search functionality for [the Historic Resources Inventory database](https://www.smgov.net/Departments/PCD/Historic-Resources-Inventory/).
