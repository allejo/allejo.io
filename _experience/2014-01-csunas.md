I maintain the [Associated Students (AS) website](http://www.csun.edu/as/), develop internal web applications used by staff, and work on Jekyll websites dedicated to projects/events hosted by AS. In the spirit of open source, I have also started [PhpPulse](https://github.com/allejo/PhpPulse), which is an API wrapper for DaPulse &mdash; the collaboration tool my team uses. The internal web applications I work on are built using either Symfony or AngularJS depending on the functionality of the specific tool. In addition to development, I also maintain the Linux server used for web hosting, file sharing, and automated tasks.
