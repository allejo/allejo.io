I maintain the [Associated Students (AS) website](http://www.csun.edu/as/), develop internal web applications used by staff, and build websites dedicated to projects or events hosted by AS. I also maintain [PhpPulse](https://github.com/allejo/PhpPulse), an API wrapper for DaPulse &mdash; the collaboration tool my team uses. The internal web applications I work on are built on top of Symfony and Vue.js, depending on the usage of the tool.
