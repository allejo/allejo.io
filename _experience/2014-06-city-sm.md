I work with two different departments within City Hall based on the season. During the summer, I help run the [Santa Monica Youth Tech Program](http://santamonicayouthtech.com) and every other season, I am part of the web development team. During the Youth Tech Program, I am the web development instructor where I teach the basics of web design and development and assist all of the students in creating websites for their respective start-ups. As part of the web development team, I work on department websites and their open source projects, such as [SODA.NET](https://github.com/CityofSantaMonica/SODA.NET).
