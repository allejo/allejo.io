I'm a part of Santa Monica's web development team where I work on building and maintaining city websites; additionally, I contribute to several of [our open source projects](https://github.com/CityofSantaMonica). Some of the bigger projects I've worked on so far have been [publishing our website analytics](http://analytics.smgov.net/) and redesigning the BigBlueBus website to be mobile responsive (still in development).

During the summers of 2014, 2015, and 2016, I assisted in running the [Santa Monica Youth Tech Program](http://santamonicayouthtech.com) where I served as a web development instructor teaching high school students the basics of web design and development.
