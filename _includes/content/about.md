Hi, I'm allejo  
<small>(or allejo256 if someone has rudely taken "allejo" on a specific website)</small>

My name's Vladimir and I'm a computer science major; it's terribly boring. To keep myself entertained, I contribute to open source projects and work on my own projects. I love the open source community and have been a part of it since I was 13 when I joined [BZFlag](http://bzflag.org) and started contributing to it; I'm now a core contributor and run the largest game server.

I've slowly branched out and have joined other open source communities such as:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Socrata](http://dev.socrata.com/)
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)

I'm socially awkward and sometimes I'm funny; I'm also notorious for breaking the build.
