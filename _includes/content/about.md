Hi, I'm allejo  
<small>(or allejome if someone has rudely taken "allejo" on a specific website)</small>

My name's Vladimir Jimenez and I'm a web developer. I spend the majority of my time pretending to know what I'm doing and to keep myself entertained, I contribute to open source projects and work on my own projects. I love the open source community and have been a part of it since I was 13 when I joined [BZFlag](http://bzflag.org) and started contributing to it.

I've slowly branched out and have joined other open source communities such as:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Socrata](http://dev.socrata.com/)
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)

I'm socially awkward and sometimes I'm funny; I'm also notorious for breaking the build.
