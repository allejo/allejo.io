            # About

            My name's Vladimir and on the Internet, I go by "allejo."

            You may recognize me as a former coworker that you liked, a mentor from a tech community, a shitposter on LinkedIn, or as a contributor to open source projects. I'm a senior software engineer currently in higher ed doing frontend development at [UC Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu), previously I was at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) until capitalism laid me off.

            I enjoy building developer tools like documentation builders, code generators, syntax highlighters, and similar tools. Building 3D worlds is a hobby of mine so I've enjoyed contributing to BZFlag, its community, and ecosystem over the past decade.

            Since 2019, I have mentored 30+ junior and 10+ mid-level developers. I speak at conferences and workplaces about accessibility, mentoring, frontend, and technical leadership.

        ## Communities

        Since I'm not busy enough and am an advocate for open source projects, these are the projects/communities that I'm actively involved in and dedicate a lot of my spare time towards.

        {{ brag_display(
            collections.communities,
            {
                heading: 'title',
                heading_url: 'url',
                start_date: 'start',
                end_date: 'end',
                content: 'content',
            }
        ) }}

        ## Employment

        It's not all just open source and games for me; just like most people, I have bills to pay too. These are the awesome companies and organizations that have helped me do so over the years.

        {{ brag_display(
            collections.experience,
            {
                heading: 'title',
                subheading: 'company',
                start_date: 'start',
                end_date: 'end',
                content: 'content',
            }
        ) }}

        ## Conference Talks

        Even though hearing the sound of my own voice weirds me out, other people like hearing me talk about things I've managed to accomplish.

        {{ brag_display(
            collections.talks | order('date', 'DESC'),
            {
                heading: 'title',
                subheading: 'conference',
                start_date: 'date',
                content: 'content',
            }
        ) }}

        ## Awards

        I occasionally take part in code related competitions whenever I'm invited to do so. Here are some notable mentions of competitions I've participated in and the work I did during the said competitions.

        {{ brag_repeater(
            collections.accomplishments | order('event_date', 'DESC'),
            {
                heading: 'title',
                subheading: 'position',
                start_date: 'event_date',
                content: 'content',
            }
        ) }}
    {% endmarkdown %}{% endset %}

    <div class="s-markdown">
        {{ page_content | anchors(
            anchorBody='<span class="sr-only">Permalink to "{heading}" section</span>',
            anchorClass='c-heading-anchor'
        ) }}
    </div>
{% endblock %}
