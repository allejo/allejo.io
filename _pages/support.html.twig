        # Support Me

        I do the majority of my open source work for fun because I enjoy it. If you've found any of my projects useful and want to support its development, here are a few ways you can.

        ## Send a Donation

        If you'd like to send a donation my way as encouragement or thanks for any of the free content I've created, here are ways for you to support me.

        ## Follow Me on Social Media

        I'm not very active on social media but I do occasionally post with regards to stuff I build or have learned; having followers makes me feel popular. Oh, let's not forget about my several attempts at being funny.

        ## Spread the Word
