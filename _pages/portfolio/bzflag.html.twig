  #maps: Beside my development work for BZFlag, I explore my creative side on occassion and design some maps.
  'plug-ins': A lot of my work for BZFlag goes to the game server code and the plug-in API. These are some of the plug-ins that I have written and continue to actively maintain and support.
  projects: I actively contribute to the community in the form of third-party projects unaffiliated with the official project.
