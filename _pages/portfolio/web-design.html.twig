  By circumstances beyond my control, I was nudged into the field of web design/development and have not left since. I
  guess you could call me a full-stack developer since I often handle everything from sysadmin to back-end development to
  front-end development. These are some of the websites that I've worked on whether it was for work, open source, or freelance.
